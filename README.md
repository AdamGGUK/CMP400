Cause and Consequence will be a 2d sandbox game made in Unity. The aim of this game will be to provide a sandbox for players, in which they can interact with a dynamic crime AI.
In order to demonstrate that this game is feasible, and to showcase the direction of the game, a prototype has been produced. This is the design document for that prototype.
In the prototype, you can move around a prototype of the small town that is the setting for the game. There is a single citizen and a cop, and being seen committing a crime by the citizen will make the citizen rush to the cop and report the crime. Then, the cop will attempt to catch you. If you manage to break the cop’s line of sight for 10 seconds, the cop will lose your trail. However, if you get caught, you’re busted.
While this is a relatively barebones experience, it forms the very foundation of the application. In the future, it will be greatly expanded upon, and include a dynamic AI, which will make the game less predictable.

Controls:
Movement – W/A/S/D
Trigger for crime – Return
Reset game – 1
Quit game - Escape


Instructions:
Navigate close to the citizen, and press Return. This will flag the player as being in the middle of a criminal act.
